Candace is behind many of the civic hackathons in Seattle. Most recently [Hack the Commute](http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov) and [Hack to End Homelessness](http://www.hacktoendhomelessness.com). All she wants to do is give it away and encourage other cities to use what she and her colleagues have created to solve their civic issues.

### Civic Hackathons

Recently at Hack the Commute, over a hundred attendees gathered together to solve the traffic issues of Seattle. There was no monetary award. Only the brightest minds willing to work together to create solutions for the community that they live in. More or less, this was a volunteer effort by both the participants, and the organizers. The teams were required to open-source their projects.

The problem with tech hackathons are that they place cash and prizes as the primary motivator for people participating. Generally, they aren't solving any widespread community issues, only to allow a group to chase their own dreams, regardless of who it helps. Civic hackathons change that; there are people out there who want to create something to benefit everyone, and care less of the monetary reward.

There are many issues that are within the public's interest, but there isn't enough of a monetary reward to motivate for-profit companies into solving them. However, there are people who are willing to join together and partner with governments and non-profits to solve problems. More resources should be going towards encouraing and empowering those people that are willing to help.

What Candace wants to do is share her efforts, and the assets that she's created while planning and organizing her Civic Hackathons. She wants to encourage other cities their own events, and solve their community-wide issues.
