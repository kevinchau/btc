> Entrepreneurship is hard. There's no way you can learn it without doing it.

Bob actively contributes to various Seattle organizations. He's on the board of Women in Tech Seattle, organizes Startup Poker 2.0, Founder to Founder, Techstars, 9Mile Labs, and TiE Young Entrepreneurs.

Coming from an entrepreneurial family, seeing and helping the family business grow from dog breeding, to rabbits, to a full on woodworking enterprise. There were lots of entrepreneurial influences growing up.

Now he's passing those experiences onto his two daughters, Sarah and Annalise.

### Women in Tech and Entrepreneurs

> Tech and entrepreneurship are two industries where women are greatly underrepresented.

Entrepreneurship is a natural thing that you can do if you want or if you don't want. However there are less women than men there. In tech, it's improving day by day, with the number of opportunities growing. But doing something on your own has always been an uphill battle.

Women in Tech exists to encourage not only tech participation, but entrepreneurship. It opens the conversation by bringing in speakers and other women that have fought that uphill battle. Increasing the percentage of women entrepreneurs begins with removing barriers, increasing the push and encouragement, and sharing inspiring stories.

Bob is trying to do with his daughters what he's doing with Women in Tech.

### Wise Walker

Wise Walker really started as a way for Bob to work on a project with his twins. The goal was to not go too big - there was no goal of fame or publicity.

> It really started with an idea to learn product and customer development. There was this lady at the dog park being pulled by a huge dog, quite grumpy in fact.

It started with customer development, it was a surprise to Bob that his Sarah and Annalise had already known what that was. That, and a visceral dislike of picking up and carrying what the dog left behind.

The idea for a Kickstarter came later.

The impact spread beyond just his daughters though. Close friends of theirs are now wanting to do something.

An excerpt from Bob's Blog: [VoxDigitas](http://voxdigitas.com)

### Mentorship

Aside from encouraging entrepreneurship with his daughters. Bob works with the Seattle startup community in advising and mentoring early stage startups. Whether that's ideas that have already began to flourish, or first time entrepreneurs chasing their passions.

Going through a handful of startups, returning his experience and expertise back to that community has been a needed and welcomed addition to the growing and the ever-increasingly-inclusive community that is Seattle entrepreneurs.
